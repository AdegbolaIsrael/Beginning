             The economy of the United States is a highly developed fixed economy. It is the world’s largest economy by nominal GDP and net wealth and the second largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). It has&nbsp;the&nbsp;world’s fifth-highest per capita GDP (nominal) and the seventh-highest per capital GDP (PPP) in 2021. The U.S dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and is the world’s foremost reserve currency, backed by its economy, its military, the petrodollar system and its linked Eurodollar and large U.S. treasuries market. The U.S is the world’s largest importer and the second-largest exporter. It is a developed advanced High-income economy.
             The Bureau of Economic Analysis measures GDP in two ways: Nominal and real GDP, United States nominal GDP as at December 2020 is 5373.7 USD billion compared to the previous quarter which is 5292.6 USD billion. Its real GDP is 20.93 USD trillion. The USA’s real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 6.4% in the first quarter of 2021, reflecting the continued economy recovery, reopening of establishments, and continued government response related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was the same rate as the second estimate released in May. In the fourth quarter of 2020, real GDP increased by 4.3%.
             Culturally, the United States is the third largest country in the world with a population of more than 325million, according to the U.S Census Bureau. A child is born every 8 seconds, and a person dies every 12 seconds. In addition to Native Americans who were already living on the continent, the population of the United States was built on immigration from other countries. Despite recent moves to close the U.S borders to new immigrants and refugees, anew immigrant moves to the United States every 33 seconds according to the Census Bureau. Because of this, the United States is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world. The United States sometimes is referred to as “melting pot” in which different cultures have contributed their own distinct “flavors” to American culture.
